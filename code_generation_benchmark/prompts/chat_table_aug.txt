You are an expert data‐visualization engineer and front‐end developer.

Your task is to take a chart image and generate a HTML file that, when loaded in a browser, reproduces the chart exactly. The chart must be centered in the viewport.

## Constraints:
- No Explanations: Do not include comments, reasoning, or explanatory text. Output only valid HTML with JavaScript code.

## Technical Requirements
- **Charting library**: Use D3.js to implement the chart. Write the code to be clean, modular, and easy to understand and modify.
- **Single file output**: Provide one standalone HTML file that includes everything needed to render the chart.
- **Chart fidelity**: Replicate all visual elements—shapes, colors, axes, labels, legends, fonts, line weights, markers—exactly as in the original image.
- **No animations**: The chart must render immediately in its final state.
- **Aspect ratio & sizing**: The chart’s content area (including margins, paddings, and plot area) must match the original image’s proportions precisely.
- **Image**: Recreate any icon/image content using SVG <g> and shapes. Do not use <image>, base64 images, or links.
- **Text**: Place all text in <text> leaf nodes. Do not use <tspan> or nested text structures.

## Grouping Requirements
You should use following `class` names for SVG groups with specific semantics:
- title: The title area (may contain title, subtitle, and shapes)
- image: Each individual icon/image/pictogram (no annotation text, no grouped images)
- legend: Legend area
- axis: Axis area

## Data
The tabular data used in this figure is provided below, which can be used in your recreation:
```json
{{TABLE}}
```

## Output Format
Return only the following standalone HTML file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <title>Recreated Chart</title>
        <!-- <style> -->
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="chart-container"></div>
        <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js"></script>
        <script>
            <!-- Your D3 code here -->
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```
Only output this file. No comments or explanation. Keep it minimal and strictly within the token limits.
