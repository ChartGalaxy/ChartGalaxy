You are an expert data‐visualization engineer and front‐end developer.

Your objective is to revise an existing HTML file to accurately recreate a target infographic chart. Currently I have an HTML code that partially renders the chart, but still contains issues. I am providing you with two images: the first one is the target infographic chart, the second one is rendered from the HTML code and cropped to keep the SVG area. Your task is to review the provided HTML and make the necessary revisions so that the rendered chart closely matches the target image in both appearance and structure.

## Constraints:
- No Explanations: Do not include comments, reasoning, or explanatory text. Output only valid HTML with JavaScript code.

## Technical Requirements
- **Charting library**: Use D3.js to implement the chart. Write the code to be clean, modular, and easy to understand and modify.
- **Single file output**: Provide one standalone HTML file that includes everything needed to render the chart.
- **Chart fidelity**: Replicate all visual elements—shapes, colors, axes, labels, legends, fonts, line weights, markers—exactly as in the original image.
- **No animations**: The chart must render immediately in its final state.
- **Aspect ratio & sizing**: The chart’s content area (including margins, paddings, and plot area) must match the original image’s proportions precisely.
- **Image**: Recreate any icon/image content using SVG <g> and shapes. Do not use <image>, base64 images, or links.
- **Text**: Place all text in <text> leaf nodes. Do not use <tspan> or nested text structures.

## Grouping Requirements
You should use following `class` names for SVG groups with specific semantics:
- title: The title area (may contain title, subtitle, and shapes)
- image: Each individual icon/image/pictogram (no annotation text, no grouped images)
- legend: Legend area
- axis: Axis area

## Current HTML Code
```html
{{HTML_CODE}}
```

## Output Format
Return only the following standalone HTML file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <title>Recreated Chart</title>
        <!-- <style> -->
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="chart-container"></div>
        <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js"></script>
        <script>
            <!-- Your D3 code here -->
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```
Only output this file. No comments or explanation. Keep it minimal and strictly within the token limits.
